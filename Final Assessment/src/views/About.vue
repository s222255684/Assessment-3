          <p>
            Here at Helpful Planner Incorporated (HPI), we strive to make a
            service that is both simple to use and enjoyable to return to. With
            an emphasis in management, we hope our application is both useful
            and pleasurable. The idea was enacted upon as the team as had
            trouble with organisation, and hoped to develop something to help
            with this issue. Created using Vue CLI, this project started as a
            challenge to test our capabilities with this method of Web Creation.
            Our app is customised to respond depending on your screen size, and
            work on all devices (Mobile, PC, Laptops, etc.). Thank you, and we
            hope you enjoy!
